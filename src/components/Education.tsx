          During my time at Boston University, I have developed a solid
          foundation in computer science principles and gained business
          management skills, which have prepared me for diverse technical roles
          in the industry. I have been involved in various academic projects and
          have taken courses that emphasize both technical and business-oriented
          problem-solving skills.
